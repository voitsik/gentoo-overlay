	<longdescription lang="en">
	Graphical user interface (GUI) libraries are usually designed to address 
	issues which are far more complex than a simple dialog box. As a consequence, 
	creating simple forms and dialogs is generally not as easy as it should be: 
	for simple data input dialogs the feature to SLOC ratio is very low.

	formlayout tries to solve this problem by providing the absolute minimum 
	API required to create the form dialog boxes. To show a dialog box, simply 
	call the fedit function. To setup a dialog box, use lists to pass the 
	required parameters (field names, default values, etc...).
